# Debiased_ML_Notebook

This guide will walk through R code for the debiased machine learning algorithm. The example used looks at the impact of access to a 401k on lifetime savings. This guide has two goals: 

1) Help the reader understand the technical details of the debiased machine learning algorithm
2) Provide a framework the reader can use to implement debiased machine learning with their own data and specifications
